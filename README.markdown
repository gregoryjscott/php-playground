# PHP Playground

This is my repo for playing with PHP.

I wanted something Sinatra-like, so I went with Slim.  I definitely want to do some database access, and maybe I’ll try out a template library like Smarty.  Eventually I’d like to deploy it to the cloud using something Heroku-like, such as Pagoda Box.  I’ll likely get distracted by something else by then and move along.
